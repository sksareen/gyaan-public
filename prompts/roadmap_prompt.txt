- Current Proficiency: {proficiency}

Create a comprehensive learning roadmap that includes:

1. Learning Path Structure:
   - Clear progression stages
   - Dependencies between concepts
   - Estimated time per stage
   - Milestone checkpoints

2. For Each Stage:
   - Learning objectives
   - Core concepts to master
   - Practical exercises
   - Projects/assignments
   - Assessment criteria
   - Resources needed

3. Progress Tracking:
   - Knowledge checkpoints
